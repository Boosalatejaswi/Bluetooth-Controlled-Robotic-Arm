# Bluetooth-Controlled-Robotic-Arm
Excited to showcase my servo motor-powered robotic arm, which I designed and built with Bluetooth control for wireless operation
# 🤖 Bluetooth-Controlled Robotic Arm
## 🔧 Hardware Components
- Arduino Uno
- HC-05 Bluetooth Module
- 3 x Servo Motors (SG90/MG996R)
- Jumper Wires
- Power Supply

## 📱 How It Works
- Connect the arm to your smartphone via **Bluetooth**
- Use an Android app like **"Bluetooth Terminal"** or custom app
- Control the servos using command characters:
  - `A / D`: Rotate base
  - `W / S`: Move arm up/down
  - `O / C`: Open/close claw
